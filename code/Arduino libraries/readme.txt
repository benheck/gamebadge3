Gamebadge sketches require these following Arduino libraries:

gameBadgePico	(custom library)
pico_ST7789	(custom library)
GBAudio		(custom library)

Locate your Arduino sketch folder:
https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415103213714-Find-sketches-libraries-board-cores-and-other-files-on-your-computer

And place these 3 folders in the /libraries folder. The main gamebadge3 sketch should now be able to find them
